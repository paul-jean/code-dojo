Given a sorted array (increasing order), write an algorithm to create a binary
tree with minimal height.

Run the `ArrayToTree` class to print an example array-to-tree conversion:

```java
    [rule146@rule146: 20131226-array-to-bin-tree]$ java ArrayToTree
    array:
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
    depth of tree = 4
    tree:
            6
        2       9
      0   4   7   11
       1 3 5   8 1012
```
