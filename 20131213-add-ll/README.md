(CTCI 2.5)
You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains
a single digit.  The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 
1's digit is at the head of the list.  Write a function that adds the two
numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
e.g.
input: 7->1->6 + 5->9->2
output: 2->1->9
