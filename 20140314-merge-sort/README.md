Implement mergesort.

By default a 20-element list of random ints is sorted:

```bash
[rule146@rule146: 20140314-merge-sort]$ node merge-sort.js 
Original list:
[ 2, 84, 26, 24, 16, 61, 11, 93, 58, 28, 42, 51, 2, 18, 27, 35, 41, 38, 66, 45 ]
Sorted list:
[ 2, 2, 11, 16, 18, 24, 26, 27, 28, 35, 38, 41, 42, 45, 51, 58, 61, 66, 84, 93 ]
```

Give an argument to specify the length:

```bash
[rule146@rule146: 20140314-merge-sort]$ node merge-sort.js 10
Original list:
[ 75, 80, 15, 1, 92, 45, 80, 84, 67, 75 ]
Sorted list:
[ 1, 15, 45, 67, 75, 75, 80, 80, 84, 92 ]
```
